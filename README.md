# calculate table

This is a little project that makes an interactive table of physical quantities that calculate on the fly.

See the [live demo](https://mgrau.github.io/calculate_table)!

## Usage

First fork this repo, clone it, and install the node packages,

```console
git clone https://github.com/<username>/calculate_table
cd calculate_table
npm install
```

To start a development server to test your changes live, run:

```console
npm start
```

After you are happy with your interactive table, you can build and deploy to github pages:

```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
